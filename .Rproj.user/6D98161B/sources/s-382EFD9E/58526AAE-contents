**I. INTRODUCTION**\

Over a decade, ASEAN has been increasingly recognized by peoples in Southeast Asian nations as a large number of such public and private organizations have been deliberately preparing their members, with an emphasis on raising their awareness in regard to effects of becoming one of the founding members of the ASEAN Community. Apart from a particular focus on ASEAN knowledge, the English abilities of citizens in each ASEAN country are considered as equally crucial since this language has been used widely as an international means for global communication.\

Inasmuch as English is reasonably essential and apparently required as concisely mentioned, not only do ASEAN universities beneficially offer English courses to students, but they also provide them with extracurricular activities, especially exchange events and competitions among educational institutions, to enhance their English proficiency and personal interactions. For this reason, Thepsatri Rajabhat University (TRU), Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah Branch (UiTM), Universitas Sarjanawiyata Tamansiswa (UST), Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HUTECH), and Universitas PGRI Adi Buana Surabaya (UNIPA) are co-organizing an online international English speech contest for those ASEAN universities in order to principally promote sustainable relationships, eventually leading to invaluable exchange of experiences in terms of ASEAN languages, cultures, and traditions between Thai and other ASEAN students.\
