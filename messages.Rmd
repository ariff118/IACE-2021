**MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT OF**  
**THEPSATRI RAJABHAT UNIVERSITY**
</center>

<br> 
International partnerships among universities are beneficial to all, ranging from students to staff. The rate of internationalization is increasingly rapid due to various communication channels and inexpensive travel. Evidently, most universities across the world are already seeking to make the most of the possibilities by forming global partnerships and fostering relationships with other institutions. This effort mainly aims to promote students’ and staff’s potential and to strengthen cultures as well as the relationship among university networks.  

Forming international university partnerships offers students an opportunity to learn not only academic and cultural aspects but also life skills. Additionally, it enables universities to better understand the cultures of other nations, thereby facilitating their marketing success there.  

The $4^{th}$ International Academic & Cultural Exchange 2021 (Online) is co-organized by Thepsatri Rajabhat University (TRU), Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah Branch (UiTM), Universitas Sarjanawiyata Tamansiswa (UST), Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HUTECH), and Universitas PGRI Adi Buana Surabaya (UNIPA) in order to provide students and staff from our university networks with valuable opportunities to present and exchange their learning and working outcomes.  

Hopefully, the $4^{th}$ International Academic & Cultural Exchange 2021 (Online) will be successful and productive for all participants and bring such strong friendship among the universities.

<br> 
First and foremost, my gratitude goes to Thepsatri Rajabhat University, especially to Madam President, Assistant Professor Chintana Vechmee, and to all faculty members and staff. It is an honour for Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah Branch, Malaysia to be part of the 4th International Academic & Cultural Exchange 2021 (Online). On behalf of UiTM Kedah Branch as the co-organizers, it gives me the utmost joy in welcoming all the participants. A warm welcome is also given to all of the co-organizers - Universitas Sarjanawiyata Tamansiswa (Indonesia), Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (Vietnam), Universitas Sebelas Maret (Indonesia), and Universitas Papua (Indonesia). I hope IACE 2021 will serve as a platform to network, exchange knowledge and strengthen the existing ties among peers.  

As part of the ASEAN community, the current pandemic situation is an eye opener. Yet, it spearheaded the adoption of online-based education, which include teaching and learning, webinars, conferences, and many more. This conference should be perceived as a stepping-stone for all - academics, researchers, practitioners as well as the public – to discuss and share viewpoints, different arguments, and experiences. I am sure that all of us are looking forward to the conference as the best platform for us to learn more about different fields of study. Let us learn from the presenters in IACE 2021 and exchange ideas in order to build a strong foundation for sustainable future.  

Finally, I wish happy conferencing to all presenters and participants of the $4^{th}$ International Academic & Cultural Exchange 2021 (Online). Thank you.

The IACE 2021 highlights the strong international partnerships among the universities, and it offers the students and staff from the partnered universities an invaluable chance to share their learning outcomes and research findings. Hence, it is strongly believed that this event can be a forum for sharings and discussions, and ultimately it will strengthen the friendship and cooperation among the universities.
